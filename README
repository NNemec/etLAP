etLAP - expression template Linear Algebra Package

(also known as "excessively templated Linear Algebra Package")

this C++ library provides simple, lightweight and efficient support
for vector and matrix calculation. Using expression templates for
maximum compile time optimization, it is designed from the very beginning
for utmost speed.

There is support for fixed size objects, allowing loop unrolling (meaning, 
that with a sensible compiler, 1x1 matrices should add virtually no overhead 
to plain numbers...) and also for variable sized objects, adding flexibility.

I have not yet done any benchmarks for direct comparison with other 
libraries, so the excellent performance that theory promises, has yet 
to be proved...

The library is far from complete, but I'm actively using it for another 
project, so it is likely to be supported for some time. If you are interested
in the code in any way, please contact me. Every user I know of will add
to the chance I spend time on the project.
